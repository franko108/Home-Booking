Home-Booking works on PHP/MySQL.

REQUIREMENTS

- Web server, Apache or some other. mod_rewrite must be enabled
- MySQL 5 
- PHP 5.2

INSTALLATION

- Make directory where programs will be stored and that web server is using for this program.
On Debian/Ubuntu Linux, and Apache web server, this is /var/www/
Directory may be: /var/www/home-booking

- Unzip the Home Booking within that directory.
(check that web server has proper permission to the program)

- Browse to the doc directory and restore the empty database.
On linux this is:
  $ mysql -p -u db_username booking < database_empty.sql
(booking will be the database name)

- Edit application/config/config.php file and change line 17 to be like this:
$config['base_url']	= 'http://localhost/home-booking/';
- Edit application/config/database.php from line 52 and put your data instead of this example:
$db['default']['username'] = 'your_db_usernam';
$db['default']['password'] = 'db_password';
$db['default']['database'] = 'booking';

- Fire your browser and go to:
http://localhost/home-database

Open help to check application, or use it straight.
Hope it helps.


This is a slower installation, maybe will make some script in the future to make installation easier and faster.
